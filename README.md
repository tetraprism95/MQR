# MQR (MAP QUEST REMAKE)
Ever wondered how to build Apple Maps, the UI &amp; searching functionality, from scratch? 
My App, MQR(Map Quest Remake) or simply an "OK" version of Apple Maps, accesses the users current location and helps to search for locations based on search query. With the destination searched, user will get a mileage or the total distance between the two points. Will Implement More!
